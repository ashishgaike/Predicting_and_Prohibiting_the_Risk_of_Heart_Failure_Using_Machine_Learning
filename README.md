# Predicting_and_Prohibiting_the_Risk_of_Heart_Failure_Using_Machine_Learning

PROJECT IDEA :

The occurrence of heart-related issues has increased by more than 50 percent from 1990 to 2016. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the risk factors and outcomes associated with heart failure, and also give Nutritional, Yoga tips  and doctor help on the same platform while sitting at home.


Software Tools :

 > IDE			             : VS code, Pycharm, Xampp server, PHP, Flask, Jupyter Notebook, SQL server.

 > Programming Language  : Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

 > Other Resources / Web : Kaggle, IEEE , Microsoft Office.

 > Libraries             : Machine Learning, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn.

APPLICATIONS :

> Prediction Of Heart failure Risk Earlier.

> Cardiologists Help is available on the website in a minimum amount.

> Nutritionists are also available on the website for diet and lifestyle change.

> Provided Yoga courses.

> free access to blogs.
